<b>Posted:</b> April 30, 2015<br>
<b>Due:</b> May 8, 2015 by midnight<br>

<p><hr><p>
<b>Note</b>: Before you get started, you should copy the code in the
file <a href="rbtree-sig.ml">rbtree-sig.ml</a>
and <a href="rbtree-mod.ml">rbtree-mod.ml</a>. You will need to use
this code in Problem 4.
<p><hr><p>

<H2>Submission Protocol</h2>

You should submit two files containing the code you have written for
this homework: the file <tt>hw8.ml</tt> containing the code for Problems 1
through 3 and the file <tt>rbtree.ml</tt> containing the code for
Problem 4. <i>Mark the solution to each problem and each part both
  files clearly, through an OCaml comment
  line next to the solution you are providing.</i> Make sure also to
stick to the names provided for the different things we want you to
define, this is critical for our understanding and testing your code.
<p>
The files that you are to submit must be uploaded to your private git
repository in the github structure for the course, i.e.,
umn-csci-2041S15/repo-abcde001. They must be accessible from the root of
this repository via the relative path <i>hw8/hw8.ml</i> and <i>hw8/rbtree.ml</i>.
<p>
Before you start working on the homework, make sure to read the
comments on <a href="index.html#hwprotocol">the protocol for homeworks
    and the issues we consider when grading</a>. Note in particular
that you must pay attention to the structure of your programs, you
must not have excessively long lines and you must use indentation to
make your program text readable. Also avoid tabs: they show up
differently under different editors and can make your code look ugly,
something that <i>does matter</i> when we grade your work.

<p>
Finally, before submitting the final version of your homework, you
should ensure it is well-formed and type-correct, i.e., contain no
syntax or type errors. If it is not you will receive no credit. You
may check this by running the following commands in the same directory as your
homework submission on a <u>cselabs</u> machine:
<blockquote>
  <pre>
   ocamlbuild hw8.byte || echo "\n\n---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---\n\n"
   ocamlbuild rbtree.byte || echo "\n\n---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---\n\n"
</pre>
</blockquote>
 If you see:
<blockquote>
  <pre>---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---</pre>
</blockquote>
for either of these commands, it means that the corresponding homework
submission is not well-formed or well-typed. You should correct this
problem before submission.

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 1 (3 + 3 points)</h2>

Consider the following function definitions
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec map f l =
   match l with
   | [] -> []
   | (h::t) -> (f h) :: map f t

let sqr n = n * n

let rec take l n =
  match (l,n) with
  | ((_,0) | ([],_)) -> []
  | (h::t,n) -> h :: (take t (n-1))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Show the step-by-step evaluation of the expression
<blockquote>
<pre>
   take (map sqr [1;2;3]) 2
</pre>
</blockquote>
under <i>call-by-name</i> evaluation. You <i>must</i> show each
step in the sequence so as to make clear how exactly computation
proceeds. Note also that when a list is shown at the interactive
level, each element of the list is evaluated.
<p>
<li>Repeat the above but this time using <i>call-by-value</i>
  evaluation.
</ol>
The answers to each part should be included in comments in the
file <i>hw8.ml</i> that you submit.

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 2 (4 + (3 + 3) + 4 points)</h2>

We will discuss in class the idea of representing an infinite object
in a finite fashion in an eager language like OCaml; the technique for
achieving this relies crucially on delaying evaluation by using what
we will refer to as a "dummy" function. A generally useful example of
an infinite object is a never-ending list, also called
a <i>stream</i>. We can define a representation for such objects by
means of the following type declaration and associated functions:
<blockquote>
<pre>
type 'a stream = Stream of (unit -> 'a * 'a stream)

let mkStream f = Stream f
let nextStream (Stream f) = f ()
</pre>
</blockquote>
As should be clear from looking at these definitions, a stream is
essentially an encapsulation of a dummy function that generates the
items in the stream, one item at a time. The
function <tt>mkStream</tt> creates this encapsulation from a
function of the required kind and the function <tt>nextStream</tt>
probes the stream, each time giving you a pair consisting of the next
item in it and an encapsulation of the rest of the stream.
<p>
Using these declarations, you can create the stream representing the infinite
sequence of natural numbers as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec fromNStream n = mkStream (fun () -> (n, fromNStream (n+1)))

let natStream = (fromNStream 1)
</pre>
</blockquote>
We assume here that the natural numbers start from 1. We can
probe the members of this stream successively as shown below:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# let (x,rst) = nextStream natStream;;
val x : int = 1
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 2
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 3
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 4
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
This problem requires you to work with the idea of streams so as to gain
some familiarity with using them.
<ol>
<li>Define the function
<blockquote>
<pre>
val mapStream : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a stream -> 'b stream = &lt;fun&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes a function and a stream of suitable types and produces a
new stream that corresponds to mapping the function over the items in
the input stream. You should be able to produce the following kind of
interaction using this function:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# let (x,rst) = nextStream (mapStream (fun x -> x+3) natStream);;
val x : int = 4
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 5
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 6
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>Provide definitions for <tt>squareStream : int stream</tt>
  and <tt>cubeStream : int stream</tt> that correspond to the
  sequences of the squares and the cubes of the natural numbers. Again
  some examples of their use:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# let (x,rst) = nextStream squareStream;;
val x : int = 1
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 4
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 9
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream cubeStream;;
val x : int = 1
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 8
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 27
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 64
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
Hint: you can provide very simple definitions for these streams by
using <tt>mapStream</tt>.
<p>
<li>Provide a definition for <tt>squarecubeStream : int
  stream</tt> that corresponds to a stream of numbers that are both
  the   squares and the cubes of other numbers. Some examples of the
  use of this stream:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# let (x,rst) = nextStream squarecubeStream;;
val x : int = 1
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 64
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
# let (x,rst) = nextStream rst;;
val x : int = 729
val rst : int stream = Stream &lt;fun&gt;
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
I also want you to solve this problem in a particular way. The new
stream should be generated by a function that does the following to
determine the next element: it repeatedly generates items in the
square and cube streams till it finds an item in common; the rest of
the two streams will be kept around in the second "stream" component
of the pair in a form needed to repeat the process.
</ol>
<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 3 ((2 + 4) + 3 points)</h2>

The way we defined streams in the previous problem was a bit
inefficient: each time we looked at a stream, we would have to
"evaluate" the function representing it to get the next item and the
remaining stream. If this evaluation step is costly, we would like to
avoid it. We can do this using the following idea: we allow the stream
to be represented by either a pair or by a function that can be
invoked to provide the pair. Moreover, we use a reference to store
this object so that we can update it to avoid re-evaluation after
we have done this once. To use this idea, we define
the <i>stream</i> type as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
type 'a stream' = Stream' of 'a stream_aux ref
and  'a stream_aux =
       | Evald of ('a * 'a stream')
       | UnEvald of (unit -> 'a * 'a stream')
</pre>
</blockquote>
Your task in this problem is to understand this definition and show
that you have understood it by using it in a few definitions.
<ol>
<li>Provide definitions for the following functions that can be used
  to create and probe streams using this new representation:
<blockquote>
<pre>
mkStream' : (unit -> 'a * 'a stream') -> 'a stream'
nextStream' : 'a stream' -> 'a * 'a stream'
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first function should be easy to figure out. You have to be a bit
careful in defining <i>nextStream'</i>. Here is why: if you
"evaluate" the stream when you do a lookup, then you should modify it so
that there is no evaluation needed the next time around.
<p>
<li>Provide a definition for <tt>natStream' : int stream'</tt> that is
  like <tt>natStream</tt> from Problem 2, except that it uses the new
  representation of streams.
</ol>
When you are all done with this problem, you should be able to produce
interactions like the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# natStream';;
- : int stream' = Stream' {contents = UnEvald &lt;fun&gt;}
# let (x,rst) = nextStream' natStream';;
val x : int = 1
val rst : int stream' = Stream' {contents = UnEvald &lt;fun&gt;}
# natStream';;
- : int stream' =
Stream' {contents = Evald (1, Stream' {contents = UnEvald &lt;fun&gt;})}
# let (x,rst) = nextStream' rst;;
val x : int = 2
val rst : int stream' = Stream' {contents = UnEvald &lt;fun&gt;}
# natStream';;
- : int stream' =
Stream'
 {contents =
   Evald
    (1, Stream' {contents = Evald (2, Stream' {contents = UnEvald &lt;fun&gt;})})}
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
Observe how the structure of <tt>natStream'</tt> gets more and more
elaborated as we look for items in it; your code should exhibit a
similar behaviour, this is the purpose of using references in this
problem.

<h2>Problem 4 (5 + 5 + 5 points)</h2>

A while ago, we looked at the binary search tree definition and saw
how we could use the idea of embedding functions in data to provide a
type declaration that allowed us to say what ordering relation was
relevant to the tree. This allowed us to realize
polymorphism that was truly parametric, i.e. we no longer had to cross
our fingers and hope that the <tt>&lt;</tt> relation "worked" on
the type. In this problem, we will see how to realize this kind of
polymorphism in a different way, using modules and functors. To keep
the problem manageable in the limited time you have for it, I will
give you almost all the code you have to write. Your task is to
exhibit an understanding of modules and functors by adding a few lines
of code to complete the definitions and by then using the definitions
to create a few different kinds of binary search tree structures.
<ol>
<li>The file <a href="rbtree-sig.ml">rbtree-sig.ml</a> contains code
  defining two signatures: the <tt>DATA</tt> signature and
  the <tt>BTREE</tt> signature. The first signature identifies the kinds
  of things that are needed over the data that we want to use as the
  elements in a binary search tree. The <tt>BTREE</tt> signature
  identifies what  functionality we will provide if we are able to
  define a binary search tree structure over the corresponding
  data. The file <a href="rbtree-mod.ml">rbtree-mod.ml</a> contains
  code that we have seen before for realizing the different functions
  based on a particular implementation---the red-black tree
  implementation---of binary search trees. However, this code is
  incomplete in two respects. First, it assumes available
  a <i>Data</i> module that provides the functionality required by the
  <tt>DATA</tt> signature. Second, it is missing a surrounding structure
  that, after type checking, assures us that the code
  in <i>rbtree-mod.ml</i> will in
  fact realize all the expected functionality for binary search trees
  if it is given <i>Data</i> structure that satisfies the properties
  described by the <tt>DATA</tt> signature.
  <p>
  Your task is to complete this missing pieces. More specifically, put
  all the code in the two files in a file called <i>rbtree.ml</i>. Then
  surround the code you have copied from the
  file <it>rbtree-mod.ml</tt> in a way that converts it into the
  definition of a <i>functor</i> with the name <i>BTree</i> that
  takes in a structure called <i>Data</i> that satisfies the
  properties identified by the <tt>DATA</tt> signature and produces a
  structure satisfying the properties identified by the <tt>BTREE</tt>
  signature. Then load the file into an OCaml interactive session
  and make sure that it compiles.
  <p>
  <b>Note:</b> that you <b>must</b> name the functor <i>BTree</i>,
  this is important for us to be able to test your code.
<p>
<li>Now add to the file the definition of a structure
  called <i>IntData</i> that meets the requirements
  of <tt>DATA</tt>. Then, using this structure and the <i>BTree</i>
  functor, complete the following definition:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  module IntBTree = ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
to realize a binary search tree structure over integer data. Test your
code by building some integer binary search trees, searching them and
printing them. We will test your code in this way, so it is a good
idea to make sure it works.
<p>
<li>Finally, show the versatility of the code you have at this point
  by using it to generate another binary search tree structure, this
  time one that works over strings. Specifically, add to the file the
  definition of a structure called <i>StringData</i> that meets the
  requirements of <tt>DATA</tt> and use this together with
  the <i>BTree</i> structure to complete the following definition:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  module StringBTree = ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
 Again, test your code by building, probing and printing a string
 binary search tree.
</ol>
<p>
In case you were wondering about the kind of behaviour to expect once
you have filled out the definitions, here is what I get from my
program. Note that the tree is printed as if it is lying on its side,
the root to the left and the branches extending rightwards.
<blockquote>
<pre>
# let inttree =
        IntBTree.insert (1,
         (IntBTree.insert (2,
            (IntBTree.insert (3,
               (IntBTree.insert (4,
                  (IntBTree.insert (5,
                      (IntBTree.insert (6,
                         IntBTree.insert (7,
                           IntBTree.insert (8,
                             IntBTree.initTree ())))))))))))));;
val inttree : IntBTree.btree = &lt;abstr&gt;
# IntBTree.print stdout inttree;;
      1
    2
  3
    4
5
    6
  7
    8
- : unit = ()
# let strtree =
        StringBTree.insert ("a",
         (StringBTree.insert ("b",
            (StringBTree.insert ("c",
               (StringBTree.insert ("d",
                  (StringBTree.insert ("e",
                      (StringBTree.insert ("f",
                         (StringBTree.insert ("g",
                            (StringBTree.insert ("h",
                               StringBTree.initTree ())))))))))))))));;
val strtree : StringBTree.btree = &lt;abstr&gt;
# StringBTree.print stdout strtree;;
      "a"
    "b"
  "c"
    "d"
"e"
    "f"
  "g"
    "h"
- : unit = ()
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
You can actually adapt the code a bit to understand how the balancing
is done, a question that Leland asked on Forum. Change the tree
printing routine a bit to also display the colour of the node. Then
see what happens to the tree as you insert nodes in it
successively. This can be fun to watch!
