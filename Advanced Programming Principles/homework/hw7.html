<b>Note</b>: Before you get started, you should copy the code in the
file <a href="hw7.ml">hw7.ml</a>. You will need to build your
solutions around this and you will also need to look at it together
with the descriptions below to understand them completely.
<p><hr><p>

<H2>Submission Protocol</h2>

Your work for this assignment must be submitted in a file
named <i>hw7.ml</i>. There are two problems in this homework. <i>Mark
  the solution to each problem clearly, through an OCaml comment
  line next to the solution you are providing.</i> The first problem
requires you to define a function called <tt>color_graph</tt> and the
second requires a function called <tt>color_graph_cps</tt>. Moreover,
each function has to realize a particular style of solution to the
same overall problem. <i>Make sure to use the given names for these
  functions and also to adhere closely to how we want you to solve the
  problems; this is crucial for credit.</i> You have also been
provided with code for displaying your solutions. Make sure to use
this code: not only will it simplify your task, it will also be
important to our being able to run your functions and to grade them. 
<p>
This file that you create with your code must be submitted to your
private git repository in this course's organization, i.e.,
umn-csci-2041S15/repo-abcde001. It must be accessible from the root of
this repository via the relative   path <i>hw7/hw7.ml</i>. 
<p>
Before you start working on the homework, make sure to read the
comments on <a href="index.html#hwprotocol">the protocol for homeworks
    and the issues we consider when grading</a>. Note in particular
that you must pay attention to the structure of your programs, you
must not have excessively long lines and you must use indentation to
make your program text readable. Also avoid tabs: they show up
differently under different editors and can make your code look ugly,
something that <i>does matter</i> when we grade your work.

<p>
Finally, before submitting the final version of your homework, you
should ensure it is well-formed and type-correct, i.e., contain no
syntax or type errors. If it is not you will receive no credit. You
may check this by running the following command in the same directory as your
homework submission on a <u>cselabs</u> machine:
<blockquote>
  <pre>ocamlbuild hw7.byte || echo "\n\n---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---\n\n"</pre>
</blockquote>
 If you see:
<blockquote>
  <pre>---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---</pre>
</blockquote>
it means your homework submission is not well-formed or well-type and
should be corrected before submission.

<h2>The Graph Colouring Problem</h2>

The problem of graph colouring is the following: we are given a
collection of nodes with (undirected) edges between them and a palate
of colours and we are asked to find a way to assign colours to the
nodes in such a way that two nodes that are adjacent do not get the
same colour.
<p>
This is a problem that turns out to be of significant practical 
importance. One place where it is useful is in colouring maps: here
the nodes are countries or states or counties, depending on what kind
of map you are looking at, and two nodes are adjacent if they
represent distinct regions that share a border. Another place where
graph colouring shows up is in assigning space (such as registers) to
the variables in a program. Think here of the space or register as a
colour (the palate is especially limited if we are thinking of the
registers in a real machine as the colours), the variables are nodes
and two variables share an edge if their values are "live" at the same
time somewhere in the program; clearly, they can be assigned the same
space/register only if they <i>do not</i> share an edge. Looked at
differently, if we are able to colour the variables satisfactorily,
then the colouring gives us a way to allocate space for them.
<p>
Graph colouring is a problem for which we do not know a good algorithm
currently and for which it is conjectured we will never know one; to
put this more precisely, it is what is known as an <i>NP-complete</i>
problem. Problems of this kind that are practically important are
often solved using search. Typically, the search uses heuristics that
help in cutting down the work in practice. In this homework, we will
take a simplistic approach, using search to solve graph colouring but
without building in any heuristics. If the problem excites you, I can
suggest some heuristics for you to try later. 
<p>
The two problems below for which you have to write code differ in the
way they want you to implement the search. Before getting to them, we
describe some things that are common to their setup. We will represent
graphs using two 
components: a list of nodes and, for each node a list of nodes
adjacent to it. As an example, consider the complete graph with 4
nodes named 1, 2, 3 and 4; for simplicity we will use numbers for
nodes. (Recall that a complete graph is one in which every node is
connected to every other node.) This graph would be represented by the
nodes list <tt>[1;2;3;4]</tt> and the adjacency list
<blockquote>
<pre>
   [(1,[2;3;4]); (2,[1;3;4]); (3,[1;2;4]); (4,[1;2;3])]
</pre>
</blockquote>
The functions you will define will also be parameterized by a
collection of colours. These will be provided in the form of a list of
strings such as the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  ["R"; "B"; "G"; "Y"]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 1</h2>

The goal in this problem is to define a function
called <tt>color_graph</tt> that takes a graph and a set of colours
presented in the fashion described above and determines a colouring
for the graph. There are, however, two special requirements:
<ul>
<li>Like in the problems in Lab 13, the function will display
  the colouring to user and interact with her/him to decide if the
  colouring is satisfactory. Thus, the type of the function should be
  the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
color_graph : int list -> (int * int list) list -> string list -> unit
</pre>
</blockquote>
Here the kind of interaction expected is the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# color_graph [1;2;3;4] [(1,[2;3;4]); (2,[1;3;4]); (3,[1;2;4]); (4,[1;2;3])] 
              ["R"; "B"; "G"; "Y"];;
  
Coloring for the graph: [(4,Y), (3,G), (2,B), (1,R)]
More solutions (y/n)? y

Coloring for the graph: [(4,G), (3,Y), (2,B), (1,R)]
More solutions (y/n)? n
- : unit = ()
# color_graph [1;2;3;4;5] 
              [(1,[2;3;4;5]); (2,[1;3;4;5]); (3,[1;2;4;5]); 
               (4,[1;2;3;5]); (5,[1;2;3;4])] 
              ["R"; "B"; "G"; "Y"];;
      
No (more) colourings possible
- : unit = ()
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
I am giving you the functions necessary for arranging the
interactions; see below. Your task will be mainly to organize the
search in the problem.
<p>
<li><b>You must organize the search in this problem using
  exceptions</b>; the next problem will get you to do the same thing using
  success and failure continuations and the whole point of this
  homework is to make sure you have understood these two different
  techniques. 
</ul>

How should we go about solving the graph colouring problem? Here is
the basic structure: 
<ol>
<li>We pick the first node that has still not been coloured and try to
  colour it; if we are successful, i.e. if it can be given a colour
  that is different from the colours given to its neighbours, we add
  the colouring and move on to the next node.
<p>
<li>The colour that we have picked for the node in the previous step
  may turn out to be "bad" in that the rest of the graph cannot be
  coloured with that choice. In this case, we would backtrack to
  considering another colour for the node. In the model to be used in
  this problem, the failure <b>must be</b> treated by raising an exception,
  specifically, the exception <tt>Search_Failure</tt>, and
  backtracking <b>must be</b> treated by catching and handling the
  exception. 
<p>
<li>On the other hand, we may succeed in colouring all the nodes
  satisfactorily. In this case, we should interact with the user using
  the <tt>ask_user</tt> function provided to you and whose behaviour
  is described below. 
</ol>

To let you focus on the core task, that of organizing the search using
exceptions, I have provided you the code for displaying a
colouring once one has been found and for checking if the user is
satisfied. Read this code and try to understand it so that you can
write such functions yourself in the future. However, here is an
example that shows you how you would use the code when you are
defining <tt>color_graph</tt>:  
<blockquote>
<pre>
# ask_user show_coloring [(1,"R"); (2,"B"); (3,"G"); (4,"Y")];;

Coloring for the graph: [(1,R), (2,B), (3,G), (4,Y)]
More solutions (y/n)? 
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that colourings are represented by lists of node and colour
pairs. After displaying the colouring, the function awaits an input
from the user. If the input is "y", it raises the
exception <tt>Search_Failure</tt>, otherwise it finishes normally. 
<p>
I have included the header for <tt>color_graph</tt> and comments with
it to help you get started on this problem. Your task is mainly to
understand the structure and to fill in the code for this function. 

<p><hr><p>
<h2>Problem 2</h2>

In this problem, we are going to solve the same graph colouring task
but this time using success and failure continuations to handle the
situations were search ends in success and where it ends in
failure. The task is to complete the definition of the function
<blockquote>
<pre>
   color_graph_cps : int list -> (int * int list) list -> string list -> unit
</pre>
</blockquote>
to realize the following computation structure:
<ol>
<li>We pick the first node that has still not been coloured and try to
  colour it; if we are successful, i.e. if it can be given a colour
  that is different from the colours given to its neighbours, we add
  the colouring to the ones we have already determined, and move on to
  colouring the next node. 
<p>
<li>The colour that we have picked for the node in the previous step
  may turn out to be "bad" in that the rest of the graph cannot be
  coloured with that choice. To prepare for this contingency, we
  should pass on a suitable failure continuation to the function that
  we are calling. Similarly, it should get a suitable success
  continuation that would enable it to do the right thing in case of
  success. 
<p>
<li>We may also fail to find a suitable colour for the node in the
  first step. In this model, we deal with this situation by calling the
  failure continuation. 
<p>
<li>Finally, we may have succeeded in colouring all the nodes in the
  graph. Now we need to interact with the user. To do this, we use the
  function <tt>ask_user_cps</tt> as described below. Of course, we
  have to pass it the right success and failure continuations to
  prepare for the situations where the user is happy with the
  colouring or rejects it. 
</ol>

The only remaining thing to be explained is how to use the code I have
provided you for displaying a solution and getting a response from the
user. If <tt>coloring</tt> is bound to a good colouring, then you
would invoke 
<blockquote>
<pre>
(ask_user_cps show_coloring colouring succ fail)
</pre>
</blockquote>
where <tt>succ</tt> and <tt>fail</tt> are suitable
continuations. Some examples that illustrate the use of this function
are the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
#  ask_user_cps show_coloring [(1,"R"); (2,"B"); (3,"G"); (4,"Y")] 
                         (fun () -> ())
                         (fun () -> Printf.printf "\nNo (more) colorings\n");;
    
Coloring for the graph: [(1,R), (2,B), (3,G), (4,Y)]
More solutions (y/n)? n
- : unit = ()
# ask_user_cps show_coloring [(1,"R"); (2,"B"); (3,"G"); (4,"Y")] 
                         (fun () -> ())
                         (fun () -> Printf.printf "\nNo (more) colorings\n");;
    
Coloring for the graph: [(1,R), (2,B), (3,G), (4,Y)]
More solutions (y/n)? y

No (more) colorings
- : unit = ()
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
Check out how the two continuations impact on behaviour after the
user's response. 
<p>
For completeness, here is an interaction I got when I ran my code:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# color_graph_cps [1;2;3;4] [(1,[2;3;4]); (2,[1;3;4]); (3,[1;2;4]); (4,[1;2;3])] 
                  ["R"; "B"; "G"; "Y"];;
  
Coloring for the graph: [(4,Y), (3,G), (2,B), (1,R)]
More solutions (y/n)? y

Coloring for the graph: [(4,G), (3,Y), (2,B), (1,R)]
More solutions (y/n)? n
- : unit = ()
# color_graph [1;2;3;4;5] 
            [(1,[2;3;4;5]); (2,[1;3;4;5]); (3,[1;2;4;5]); 
             (4,[1;2;3;5]); (5,[1;2;3;4])] 
            ["R"; "B"; "G"; "Y"];;

No (more) colourings possible
- : unit = ()
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
