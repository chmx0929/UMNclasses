<H2>Submission Protocol</h2>

This homework does not involve any programming work. However, you
should still turn in solutions electronically, in a file named
hw6.txt. <i>Make sure to indicate which problem each part of the file
  you turn corresponds to.</i> Also note that each problem has
several parts and your annotations should indicate the part of the
problem being solved. For example, just before the solution to Part
1(a) of Problem 1, write "Problem 1, Part 1(a)."
<p>
The hw6.txt file must be submitted to your private git repository in
this course's
organization, i.e., umn-csci-2041S15/repo-abcde001. It must be accessible
from the root of this repository via the relative
  path <i>hw6/hw6.txt</i>.

<p>
Although this homework requires no programming, you may still find it
interesting to play around with the code underlying it. This code is
provided <a href="hw6code.ml">here</a>.

<h2>Problem 1 ((2 + 2) + (2 + 2 + 2) + (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1)
  points)</h2>

<b>Note:</b> Part 4 has been made optional.

<p>
We mentioned in class that if we were really interested in dealing
with arbitrarily large numbers, then we should not be using the
representation of numbers built into OCaml but, rather, we should roll
our own. We had some discussion about what might be a
reasonable representation and also about whether or not we could think
of ordinary operations like addition and multiplication being
independent of the size of the input. This problem explores some
of these issues.

<ol>
<li> We have seen a representation of natural numbers already, based
  on the following type declaration
<blockquote>
<pre>
   type nat = Zero | Succ of nat
</pre>
</blockquote>
This representation is what you might call a "unary"
representation. We can think of "converting" a number in the builtin
representation for integers into one in the unary representation using
the following function:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  let rec to_unary n =
     match n with
     | 0 -> Zero
     | n -> Succ (to_unary (n-1))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<ol type = a>
<li>Write a recurrence equation for the size of the output
  of the function in terms of the input; use the
  expression <i>S(n)</i> to represent the size of the output for the
  input <i>n</i>. In writing this equation,
  assume that a representation of <tt>Zero</tt> requires constant space and
  a representation of <tt>(Succ n)</tt> adds constant space to what is
  required to represent <tt>n</tt>.
<p>
<li> Solve the recurrence equation to express the size of the output
  of <tt>to_unary</tt> as as function of the number being represented.
</ol>
<p>
<li>Another way to represent natural numbers may be to use a binary
  system. The following type provides us a means to realize such a
  representation:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  type bin_nat =  BO | BT of bin_nat | BS of bin_nat
</pre>
</blockquote>
To understand this representation, think
of <tt>BO</tt> as the representation of <tt>0</tt>, of <tt>(BT b)</tt>
as the representation of the number that is two times
whatever <tt>b</tt> represents and <tt>(BS b)</tt> as the representation
of 1 plus two times whatever <tt>b</tt> represents. If you think about
this a little, what this gives us is a binary representation of a number,
written with the outermost constructor representing the rightmost bit,
ending with 0 as the most significant bit. For example, the number 11
in the decimal system would be
written as <tt>1011</tt> in binary, which, adding a <tt>0</tt> as a most
significant bit, is the same as <tt>01011</tt>. This binary number
will then be represented as <tt>(BS (BS (BT (BS BO))))</tt>.
<p>
As in the
case of the unary representation, we could think of a conversion of a
number in the builtin representation of integers in OCaml to one using
this representation based on the following function:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec to_binary n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> BO
  | n -> if ((n mod 2) = 0) then BT (to_binary (n/2))
         else BS (to_binary (n/2))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<ol type = a>
<li>As for the function for converting to unary, write a recurrence
  equation for the size of the output of the function in terms of the
  input, using <i>S'(n)</i> to represent the size for
  input <i>n</i>. Use similar assumptions for quantifying the size of
  constructors as you did in the first part.
<p>
<li> Solve the recurrence equation to express the size of the output
  of <tt>to_binary</tt> as as function of the number being
  represented.
<p>
<li>Express the size of the unary representation as a function of the
  binary representation. Hint: You should be able to conclude from
  this that the unary representation is not a reasonable one to use
  from the perspective of space usage.
</ol>
<p>
<li>We can implement the <tt>plus</tt> function on numbers represented
  in binary as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
type carry = Zero | One

let plus b1 b2 =
  let rec percolate_carry =
     function
     | (b,Zero) -> b
     | (BO,One) -> BS BO
     | (BS b,One) -> BT (percolate_carry (b,One))
     | (BT b,One) -> BS b
  in
  let rec plus_with_carry =
     function
     | ((BO,b,c) | (b,BO,c)) -> percolate_carry (b,c)
     | (BS b1,BS b2,Zero) -> BT (plus_with_carry (b1,b2,One))
     | (BS b1,BS b2,One) -> BS (plus_with_carry (b1,b2,One))
     | ((BS b1,BT b2, Zero) | (BT b1, BS b2, Zero)) ->
          BS (plus_with_carry (b1,b2,Zero))
     | ((BS b1,BT b2,One) | (BT b1, BS b2, One)) ->
          BT (plus_with_carry (b1,b2,One))
     | (BT b1, BT b2, Zero) -> BT (plus_with_carry (b1,b2,Zero))
     | (BT b1, BT b2, One) -> BS (plus_with_carry (b1,b2,Zero))
  in plus_with_carry (b1,b2,Zero)
</pre>
</blockquote>
In this part, we want to estimate the cost of addition using the
binary representation as a function of the sizes of the two inputs. In
estimating costs here and elsewhere in the homework, remember that we
always assume the worst case. Also, use a simple estimate of size:
each <tt>BO</tt>, <tt>BS</tt> and <tt>BT</tt> adds one to the size. (A
more complicated estimate would only multiply this by a constant.)
<ol type = a>
<p>
<li>The function <tt>percolate_carry</tt> takes a pair of the
  form <tt>(b,c)</tt> as input. Provide a recurrence equation for the
  time its evaluation takes as a function of the size of <tt>b</tt>,
  the first component of this pair. Write <i>T(n)</i> to denote the
  time taken for input <tt>(b,c)</tt> where <i>n</i> represents the
  size of <tt>b</tt>.
<p>
<li>Solve the recurrence equation to express the time taken
  by <tt>percolate_carry</tt> as a function of the size of the first
  component of its input.
<p>
<li>The function <tt>plus_with_carry</tt> takes a triple of the
  form <tt>(b1,b2,c)</tt> as its input. Provide a recurrence equation
  for the time its evaluation takes as a function of the sizes
  of <tt>b1</tt> and <tt>b2</tt>, the first and second components of
  the triple. Write <i>T'(n<sub>1</sub>,n<sub>2</sub>)</i> to denote
  the time taken for input <tt>(b1,b2,c)</tt>,
  where <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> represents the size of <tt>b1</tt>
  and <i>n<sub>2</sub></i> represents the size of <tt>b2</tt>. Note
  that you will need to use the cost of <tt>percolate_carry</tt> (and,
  hence, the analysis in the previous parts) in writing this expression.
<p>
<li>Solve the recurrence equation to express the time taken
  by <tt>plus_with_carry</tt> as a function of the sizes
  of <tt>b1</tt> and <tt>b2</tt> in its input <tt>(b1,b2,c)</tt>
<p>
<li>Conclude with an estimate of the time taken by <tt>plus</tt> as a
  function of the sizes of its two inputs.
</ol>
<p>
<li>We can similarly implement multiplication on numbers represented
  in binary as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec mult b1 b2 =
  match b1 with
  | BO -> BO
  | BS b1' -> plus b2 (BT (mult b1' b2))
  | BT b1' -> BT (mult b1' b2)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<ol type = a>
<li>Provide a recurrence equation for the time that <tt>mult</tt>
  takes, expressed as a function of the sizes of its two inputs. Use
  the expression <i>T(n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>)</i> to represent
  the time taken, where <i>n<sub>1</sub></i> is the size of the first
  input and <i>n<sub>2</sub></i> is the size of the second input.
<p>
<li>Solve the recurrence equation to express the time taken
  by <tt>mult</tt> as a function of the sizes of its inputs.
</ol>
</ol>
Can you also similarly estimate the size of the output
of <tt>plus</tt> and <tt>mult</tt> as a function of the sizes of their
inputs? Also, if you are sufficiently intrigued by the binary
representation discussed in this problem, you  might try to write a
function for calculating exponentiation. If you do this, try both
possibilities we would have discussed in class, the naive one and the
one that divides the exponent by two at least every other iteration,
and see what you can say about the difference in times taken by the
two.

<h2>Problem 2 (4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 5 points)</h2>

There are practically relevant contexts such as ones dealing with
encryption where we want to carry out the following computation: given three
numbers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, we want to
calculate <i>a<sup>b</sup> mod p</i>. We could try to do this in a
naive way, by first calculating <i>a<sup>b</sup></i> and then taking
the modulus of the result with respect to <i>p</i>. Unfortunately
this approach does not work very well if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are big
numbers: in trying to calculate <i>a<sup>b</sup></i>, we quickly end up
  with numbers that are so large that they will not fit in the space
  allocated to the representation of integers within OCaml, and we
then start
  getting wierd results because of overflow issues. In this problem,
  we will consider an alternative method that keeps numbers small and
  that also builds in some of the insights we had seen in dramatically
  reducing the number of recursive calls to yield an efficient way to
  compute this expression.
<ol>
<li>Prove the following equality about numbers: <i>((a * b) mod p) =
    ((a mod p) * (b mod p)) mod p</i>.
<br>Hint: Think of writing <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in terms of <i>p</i>
  and then see what simplifications you can carry out.
<p>
<li>Consider the following function definition in OCaml
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec exp_mod a b p =
   match b with
   | 0 -> 1 mod p
   | _ ->
      if (b mod 2 = 0)
      then let n = (exp_mod a (b/2) p) in
              (n * n) mod p
      else ((a mod p) * (exp_mod a (b-1) p)) mod p
</pre>
</blockquote>
Using strong induction on natural numbers and the fact you have shown
in the first part of this problem, prove the following fact about this
function:
<blockquote>
   For all natural numbers a, b, and p, (exp_mod a b p) evaluates to
   a<sup>b</sup> mod p.
</blockquote>
Assume that the arithmetic operations of multiplication, division and
modulus all follow the ideal behaviour, i.e. there will be no overflow
or underflow issues.<br>
Hint: Try induction on b.
<p>
<li> Put a bound on the sizes of numbers that we will have to deal
  with in the computation carried out by <tt>exp_mod</tt>; this should
  explain why it is (more) reasonable to assume that we will not have
  overflow errors in this approach to computing the result we
  want. <br>
Hint: Express the largest numbers we will see as a number that not much
  bigger than a, b and p.

<p>
<li> Provide a recurrence relation that expresses an upper bound on
  the time taken by <i>exp_mod</i> as a function of its second
  argument. In other words, writing <i>T(b)</i> for the time taken,
  your recurrence relation should be of the form
<blockquote>
     <i>T(b)</i> &le; ...
</blockquote>
where the ... part may use <i>T(b')</i> for some <i>b'</i> that is
related to <i>b</i>. Justify any relation that you write down; this
and the fact that the relation that you define can be used to solve
the next part will carry almost the entire weight.
<p>
<li>Using the recurrence relation, show that the time taken
  by <i>(exp_mod a b p)</i> is <i>O(log<sub>2</sub>(b))</i>; if you have
  forgotten what the latter means, what you have to show is that there
  is some constant <i>c</i> such that for values of <i>b</i> larger
  than some <i>b<sub>0</sub></i> it is the case that <i>(exp_mod a b p)
  &le; c * log<sub>2</sub>(b)</i>.
</ol>

<h2>Problem 3 (4 + 4 + 5 points)</h2>

The following code defines an OCaml function <tt>mergesort</tt> that
sorts a list of objects on which the <tt><</tt> relation is defined:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec partition l =
  match l with
    | [] -> ([],[])
    | [_] -> (l,[])
    | (h1::h2::l') ->
        let (t1,t2) = partition l' in (h1::t1,h2::t2)

let rec merge l1 l2 =
  match (l1,l2) with
  | (([],l) | (l,[])) -> l
  | (h1::t1,h2::t2) ->
        if (h1 < h2) then h1 :: merge t1 l2
        else h2 :: merge l1 t2

let rec mergesort l =
  match l with
  | ([] | [_]) -> l
  | _ -> let (l1,l2) = partition l
         in let l1' = mergesort l1
         in let l2' = mergesort l2
         in merge l1' l2'
</pre>
</blockquote>
For simplicity, assume that the length of the list input
to <tt>mergesort</tt> is always a power of 2. The task in this problem
is to eventually show that the time taken
by <tt>mergesort</tt> is &Omega;(n * k),
where <i>n</i> is the length of the input list and <i>n =
  2<sup>k</sup></i>, i.e. <i>k = log<sub>2</sub>(n)</i>.
<ol>
<li>Provide a recurrence relation for <i>T(n)</i>, the running time
  for <tt>partition</tt> expressed as a function of the length of the
  input list, and use this to argue that its running time
  is <i>O(n)</i>. 
<p>
<li>Provide a recurrence relation for <i>T'(n1,n2)</i>, the running
  time for <tt>merge</tt> expressed as a function of the
  length of its two input lists, and use this to argue that this
  time is <i>O(n1+n2)</i>.
  lists.
<p>
<li>Provide a recurrence relation for <i>T''(n)</i>, the length of
  the running time for <tt>mergesort</tt> expressed as a function of the
  length of its input list, and use this to argue that this
  time is <i>O(n * log(n))</i>.
