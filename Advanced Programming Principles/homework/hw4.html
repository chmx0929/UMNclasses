<H2>Submission Protocol</h2>

All of your work for this assignment must be submitted in a file
named <i>hw4.ml</i>. <i>Mark the solutions clearly as solutions to
  the corresponding problems; this must be done in an OCaml comment
  line next to the solution.</i>
This file must be submitted to your private git repository in this course's
organization, i.e., umn-csci-2041S15/repo-abcde001. It must be accessible
from the root of this repository via the relative
  path <i>hw4/hw4.ml</i>. The programming problems are specific about
  the names of the types, functions and the types of the functions you
  must define. You <b>must</b> stick to the requirements spelled out
  in each case; if you don't do this, you will not get credit for what
  you have done for that part. In the first problem, you are required
to complete the missing parts in a definition. You <b>must</b> define
the function needed by doing this; ignoring the partial definition
already provided and writing your own code for the function will not
get you credit.

<p>
Before you start working on the homework, make sure to read the
comments on <a href="index.html#hwprotocol">the protocol for homeworks
    and the issues we consider when grading</a>. Note in particular
that you must pay attention to the structure of your programs, you
must not have excessively long lines and you must use indentation to
make your program text readable. Also avoid tabs: they show up
differently under different editors and can make your code look ugly,
something that <i>does matter</i> when we grade your work.

<p>
Finally, before submitting the final version of your homework, you
should ensure it is well-formed and type-correct, i.e., contain no
syntax or type errors. If it is not you will receive no credit. You
may check this by running the following command in the same directory as your
homework submission on a <u>cselabs</u> machine:
<blockquote>
  <pre>ocamlbuild hw4.byte || echo "\n\n---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---\n\n"</pre>
</blockquote>
 If you see:
<blockquote>
  <pre>---INCORRECT SUBMISSION---</pre>
</blockquote>
it means your homework submission is not well-formed or well-type and
should be corrected before submission.

<h2>Problem 1 (3 points for each function, 1 extra point for addOnePair)</h2>

This problem is modelled on an application for the map-reduce paradigm
that is
described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12375761/good-map-reduce-examples-for-explanation">here</a>. The
task is to calculate all the friends in common between all pairs of
(Facebook) friends. 
<p>
The 
general structure of the problem is the following. For each person we
have given to us a list of friends. For example,
if <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>c</tt>, <tt>d</tt> and <tt>e</tt> 
are the people in question, the corresponding list of friends may be
the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
a -> b c d
b -> a c d e
c -> a b d e
d -> a b c e
e -> b c d
</pre>
</blockquote>
What we want to compute eventually is an list of common friends for
each pair of friends. For example, from the information given above, we
want to compute the following information:
<blockquote>
<pre>
(a b) -> (c d)
(a c) -> (b d)
(a d) -> (b c)
(b c) -> (a d e)
(b d) -> (a c e)
(b e) -> (c d)
(c d) -> (a b e)
(c e) -> (b d)
(d e) -> (b c)
</pre>
</blockquote>
This problem structures this computation as a map-reduce one. Your
task is to understand this structure and to fill in the missing pieces
in some function definitions to complete the solution.
<p>
At the very beginning, we have to decide how to represent "persons."
We will do this using their names, written as strings. Thus, the
person written as <tt>a</tt> above will be represented by the
string <tt>"a"</tt>. We will then represent the input in the problem
by a list of pairs, the first item of each pair being a person and the
second a list of his/her friends. Thus, the input in the example above
will be encoded as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
   [ ("a", ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
     ("b", ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]);
     ("c", ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]);
     ("d", ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
     ("e", ["b"; "c"; "d"]) ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
In the rest of the description below, we will assume that the
identifier <tt>friendsList</tt> has been bound to this list through a
declaration of the form
<blockquote>
<pre>
let friendsList =
   [ ("a", ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
     ("b", ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]);
     ("c", ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]);
     ("d", ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
     ("e", ["b"; "c"; "d"]) ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not surprisingly, the solution to a problem of the kind described will
involve a <i>mapping</i> and a <i>reducing</i> phase. 
<ol>
<li>In the mapping phase, we will transform the
  input into a list of lists, where each list associates the friends
  of a person with pairs consisting of that person and each of his/her
  friends. For example, given <tt>friendsList</tt> as input, we want
  to transform this into the list
<blockquote>
<pre>
[[(("a", "b"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("a", "c"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
  (("a", "d"), ["b"; "c"; "d"])];
 [(("a", "b"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]);
  (("b", "d"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "e"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"])];
 [(("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]);
  (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("c", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])];
 [(("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
  (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("d", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])];
 [(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
  (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"])]]
</pre>
</blockquote>
One thing to note here: when we pair two people together, we will
represent them by using their names in alphabetical order in the
pair. For example, the pair representing <tt>"a"</tt> and <tt>"b"</tt>
will be written as <tt>("a","b")</tt>, whereas the pair
representing <tt>"c"</tt> and <tt>"b"</tt> will be written
as <tt>("b","c")</tt>.
<p>
We will implement the mapping transformation in two steps:
<ol type = a>
<li>Given a person and a list of his/her friends, define a
  function <tt>makePairLists</tt> that will associate the list with
  each pair of the person and a friend. Here is an example interaction
  that shows the behaviour we expect of the function:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# makePairLists "b" ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"];;
- : ((string * string) * string list) list =
[(("a", "b"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "e"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"])]
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can define <tt>makePairLists</tt> in many ways but in this problem
we want you to define it via a mapping operation. In particular, fill
in the blank in the partial definition below to complete it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
 let makePairLists p fl = List.map ___ fl
</pre>
</blockquote>
Compare the behaviour of your function with that shown above. 
<p>
<li> Now define the function <tt>makeAllPairLists</tt> that will take
  the input to the problem and will transform it into the form we want
  as output of the mapping phase. An interaction that shows the
  behaviour of this function is the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
 makeAllPairLists friendsList;;
- : ((string * string) * string list) list list =
[[(("a", "b"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("a", "c"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
  (("a", "d"), ["b"; "c"; "d"])];
 [(("a", "b"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]);
  (("b", "d"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "e"), ["a"; "c"; "d"; "e"])];
 [(("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]);
  (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("c", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])];
 [(("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
  (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("d", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])];
 [(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
  (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"])]]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can again define this function in many ways, but what we want to do
  in this problem is realize it explicitly as a mapping operation. In
  particular, fill in the blanks below to complete its definition:
<blockquote>
<pre>
 let makeAllPairLists l =  List.map ___ l
</pre>
</blockquote>
Hint: think of using the function <tt>makePairLists</tt> defined in
  the first subpart above in constructing the mapping function.
</ol>
<p>
<li>The second phase will "reduce" the list constructed in the first
  phase to produce the output desired in this problem. The key out
  here would be to define the aggregation function. This function
  would implement the following idea. One of its inputs will be a list
  that associates the friends of a person with each pair of that
  person and his/her friends such as, for example,
<blockquote>
<pre>
[(("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]);
  (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("c", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])]
</pre>
</blockquote>
Another of its inputs will be a partially constructed output, obtained
by aggregating the later (or earlier, depending on the kind of folding
being done) lists of this kind. This could,
for example, be the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
[(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
 (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])]
</pre>
</blockquote>
These two lists represent the possible shared friends from two
different perspectives. For example, the first input indicates that
the shared friends for <tt>"c"</tt> and <tt>"e"</tt> are limited
to <tt>["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]</tt> because these are the only
friends <tt>"c"</tt> has. Relatedly the second input indicates that
the shared friends for <tt>"c"</tt> and <tt>"e"</tt> are limited
to <tt>["b"; "c"; "d"]</tt> because these are the only
friends <tt>"e"</tt> has. We want to combine these perspectives to
conclude that the common friends for <tt>"c"</tt> and <tt>"e"</tt>
are <tt>["b"; "d"]</tt>, the intersection of their two friends
lists. More completely, given the above two inputs, we want our
aggregation function to compute the new partial output
<blockquote>
<pre>
[(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "d"]);
 (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "e"]);
 (("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
We will construct the aggregation function in the following steps.
<ol type = a>
<li>One operation that we will need is that of constructing the
  intersection of two sets of friends. As in Lab 7, we represent sets
  as lists in with a particular item appears at most once. As we did
  for union in Lab 7, we will define intersection using an aggregation
  function. In particular, complete its definition by filling the
  blanks in the following partial definition:
<blockquote>
<pre>
 let intersect l1 l2 = List.fold_right ___ l1 ___
</pre>
</blockquote>
Test that it works correctly by using examples such as that of
combining the potential list of common friends of <tt>"c"</tt>
and <tt>"e"</tt> into one list of actual common friends as discussed
above. 
<p>
<li>Now define the function <tt>addOnePair</tt> that takes one pair of
  friends and a list of potential common friends and assimilates this
  information into a previously computed, partial list of common
  friends. Some example interactions that show the expected behaviour
  of this function:
<blockquote>
<pre>
addOnePair
  (("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])
  [(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
   (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
   (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])];;
    - : ((string * string) * string list) list =
[(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
 (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
 (("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])]
# addOnePair
  (("c", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])
  [(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
   (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
   (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])];;
        - : ((string * string) * string list) list =
[(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "d"]);
 (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])]
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that in the first case the pair gets added as is to the partial
list of common friends because there isn't another previous
perspective of common friends for <tt>"a"</tt> and <tt>"c"</tt>
whereas in the second case, two different perspectives of the common
friends of <tt>"c"</tt> and <tt>"e"</tt> have to be combined. Note
also that I had to define this function without using the aggregation
or mapping functions, I could not see a way to do it otherwise.
<p>
<li>Finally, define the aggregation function
  called <tt>addAllPairs</tt> that will take a list that associates
  the friends of a person with each pair of that person and his/her
  friends and a partially aggregated output to construct a more
  accurate aggregated output. An example interaction to indicate the
  expected behaviour for <tt>addAllPairs</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# addAllPairs 
  [(("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]);
   (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("c", "e"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])]
  [(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]);
   (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
   (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"])];;
    - : ((string * string) * string list) list =
[(("b", "e"), ["b"; "c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "d"]);
 (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "e"]);
 (("a", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "b"; "d"; "e"])]
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
This function can be defined by aggregation using the previously
defined <tt>addOnePair</tt> function. In particular, fill in the
blanks below to complete its definition:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let addAllPairs ppls l = List.fold_left ___ l ppls
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p>
<li>The only remaining thing is to put the mapping and the
  aggregation operations together in a map-reduce combination to get a
  solution to the problem. Use the following code to do this
<blockquote>
<pre>
  let commonFriends l = List.fold_right addAllPairs (makeAllPairLists l) []
</pre>
</blockquote>
If you have defined the functions used in
implementing <tt>commonFriends</tt> correctly, you should get
behaviour of the following sort:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# commonFriends friendsList;;
- : ((string * string) * string list) list =
[(("b", "e"), ["c"; "d"]); (("c", "e"), ["b"; "d"]);
 (("d", "e"), ["b"; "c"]); (("a", "d"), ["b"; "c"]);
 (("b", "d"), ["a"; "c"; "e"]); (("c", "d"), ["a"; "b"; "e"]);
 (("a", "c"), ["b"; "d"]); (("b", "c"), ["a"; "d"; "e"]);
 (("a", "b"), ["c"; "d"])]
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<h2>Problem 2 (3 points for each of the part (1), (3), (4) and (5), 2
  points each for the other parts)</h2>

An ordered list is a list in which an element that appears later in
the list is never smaller than an element that appears earlier in the
list, where the notion of "smaller than" is given by a specific chosen
relation. For example, the list 
<blockquote>
<pre>
   [1; 5; 7; 12; 13]
</pre>
</blockquote>  
is an ordered list relative to the usual <tt><</tt> relation on
numbers, the list 
<blockquote>
<pre>
   [17; 14; 9; 6; 2]
</pre>
</blockquote>  
is an ordered list relative to the <tt>></tt> relation on numbers but
not relative to the <tt><</tt> order and the list
<blockquote>
<pre>
   [17; 14; 9; 13; 2]
</pre>
</blockquote>
is an ordered list relative to neither the usual <tt><</tt> nor the
usual <tt>></tt> relation on numbers. 

<ol>
<li> Clearly, whether or not a list is ordered is dependent also on
  the ordering relation in use. Define a type
  constructor <tt>olist</tt> that is like the <tt>list</tt> type
  constructor except that values of this type carry enough information
  to determine whether or not they are ordered lists relative to the
  intended ordering relation. 
<p>
<li>Define a function
<blockquote>
<pre>
   initOList : ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a olist
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes an ordering relation over a given type and returns an empty
  <tt>olist</tt> of that type. 
<p>
<li>Using let declarations, bind <tt>list1</tt> and <tt>list2</tt> to
  two different values of <tt>int olist</tt> type that use different
  ordering relations and that satisfy the invariant based on that
  ordering relation. Then bind <tt>list3</tt> to a value of <tt>int
  olist</tt> that does not satisfy the necessary invariant.
<p>
<li> Define a function 
<blockquote>
<pre>
   isOrderedList : ('a olist) -> bool
</pre>
</blockquote> 
that takes an ordered list and determines whether or not it satisfied
the required ordering invariant based on the intended ordering
relation. Test this function using the
identifiers <tt>list1</tt>, <tt>list2</tt> and <tt>list3</tt>.
<p>
<li> Define a function 
<blockquote>
<pre>
   insertOList : 'a -> ('a olist) -> ('a olist)
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes an element and an ordered list and returns an ordered list
that has all the original elements plus the new one and that continues
to satisfy the invariant based on the relevant ordering property.
<p> 
<li> Define a function
<blockquote>
<pre>
  olistToList : 'a olist -> 'a list
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes an ordered list and converts it into an ordinary list with
the same elements and in the same order as in the given olist.
</ol>

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 3 (4 + 6 points)</h2>

Transform the functions shown below into a tail-recursive form by
using continuations in the manner (to be) discussed in class. Use the
names indicated for the transformed versions of the functions; we need
you to do this for our automated testing tools to work.
<ol>
<li>The append function
<blockquote>
<pre>
   let rec append l1 l2 =
     match l1 with 
     | [] -> l2
     | (h::t) -> h::append t l2
</pre>
</blockquote>
The function you should define in this case is the following:
<blockquote>
<pre> 
   cont_append : 'a list -> 'a list -> ('a list -> 'b) -> 'b
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> Suppose that we have defined the <tt>btree</tt> type constructor
  as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
   type 'a btree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a btree * 'a btree
</pre>
</blockquote>
The function to transform is then the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
   let rec sumTree t =
     match t with 
     | Empty -> 0
     | Node (i,l,r) -> i + sumTree l + sumTree r
</pre>
</blockquote>
The function you should define is the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  cont_sumTree : int btree -> (int -> 'a) -> 'a
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>
