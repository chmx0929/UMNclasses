<H2>Submission Protocol</h2>

All of your work for this assignment must be in a file
named <i>hw2.ml</i>. Include your solutions for the first problem in a
comment in this file. Indicate the invariant for <tt>fib</tt> in
Problem 2 in a comment preceding the definition of the
function. Similarly, put your explanation of the use of
the <tt>option</tt> in Problem 3 in a comment. 
<i>Mark the solutions clearly as solutions to the corresponding
  problems; this must be done in an OCaml comment line next to the
  solution.</i> 
This file must be submitted to your private git repository in this course's
organization, i.e., umn-csci-2041S15/repo-abcde001. It must be accessible 
from the root of this repository via the relative
  path <i>hw2/hw2.ml</i>. The programming problems are specific about
  the names of the types, functions and the types of the functions you
  must define. You <b>must</b> stick to the requirements spelled out
  in each case; if you don't do this, you will not get credit for what
  you have done for that part. 

<p>
Before you start working on the homework, make sure to read the
comments on <a href="index.html#hwprotocol">the protocol for homeworks
    and the issues we consider when grading</a>. Note in particular
that you must pay attention to the structure of your programs, you
must not have excessively long lines and you must use indentation to
make your program text readable. Also avoid tabs: they show up
differently under different editors and can make your code look ugly.

<h2>Problem 1 (3 + 3 points)</h2>

For each of the purported function definitions below, indicate whether
OCaml will determine that it is well-typed. If it is well-typed,
indicate the type and go explicitly through the steps by which this
type is determined as we did for <tt>append</tt> in class. If it is
not well-typed, explain clearly and completely what the problem is; in
other words, go through the process of trying to infer a type and then
show the conflict that results in the type error.
<p>
You may of course use OCaml to check your intuitions about the
definitions and typing but note that this by itself <b>will not</b>
constitute an adequate answer to the question. You must go through
the process of type checking/type inference as we discussed in class
to reach the conclusion you state. 
<ol>
<li>This is an attempt to define the function <tt>zip</tt>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  let rec zip lp =
   match lp with 
   | ([],_) -> []
   | (_,[]) -> []
   | ((x::l1),(y::l2)) -> (x,y) :: zip (l1,l2)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<li>This time we are trying to define a <tt>reverse</tt> function
<blockquote>
<pre>
let rec reverse l =
   match l with 
   | [] -> []
   | (h::t) -> (reverse t) :: h
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 2 (4 + 2 + 2 points) </h2>

<ol>
<li>Consider the following iterative program to compute the Fibonnaci of a
positive number <tt>n0</tt>; as we did in class, we are using
pseudo-OCaml in showing this iterative version
<blockquote>
<pre>
  n = n0;
  i = 1;
  fib1 = 1;
  fib2 = 1;
  while (i != n) {
    temp = fib1; 
    fib1 = fib2;
    fib2 = fib2 + temp;
    i = i + 1
  }
  return fib1;
</pre>
</blockquote>
As we did in class for <tt>fact</tt> and <tt>reverse</tt>, translate
this form into a tail-recursive definition of a function
called <tt>fib'</tt>. A hint to get you started: the function should
have four or five arguments, depending on whether or not you decide to
represent <tt>temp</tt> explicitly as an argument.
<p>
<li>Once you have written the definition of <tt>fib'</tt> present a one
  line invariant describing what the function computes, based on
  assumptions about its inputs.
<p>
<li>Using the <tt>fib'</tt> as an auxiliary nested function, write a
  definition of the function <tt>fib : int -> int</tt> that computes
  the Fibonnaci of its input,. Assume that this input is a positive
  number. 
</ol>

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 3 (2 + 2 + 2 points)</h2>

Revisit Problem 6 from Homework 1. Several questions were asked on
Forum about how to deal with the situation when the database did not
contain an entry for a particular person. Explain how you can fix this
using the <tt>option</tt> type. Then redefine
both <tt>find_salary</tt> and <tt>find_phno</tt> using this idea to 
overcome the problem. 
<p>
<b>Note:</b> In case this is not already clear, we <i>are</i>
expecting to see changed definitions for the two functions (with the
same types as in Homework 1 except for the use of the <tt>option</tt>
type to fix the problem we were having earlier) for this problem.

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 4 (5 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 8 points)</h2>

In this problem, we will consider using a binary search tree to
represent a database such as the person database we considered in
Problem 6 of Homework 1 and Problem 3 above. We will separate out one
item of the tuples we want to represent as the <i>key</i> based on
which we will organize the tree, and the remaining items will form
the <i>data</i> corresponding to the key. The key is also often
called the <i>index</i> to the data. For example, in the employee
database, the key or index might be the name of the employee and the
data may be a tuple consisting of the salary and the phone number. The 
information in the data base would then be organized into a tree
structure such as the following 
<blockquote>
<pre>
                    (key1,data1)
                     /       \
                    /         \
              (key2,data2)  (key3,data3)
               /       \      /     \
              /         \    /       \
         (key4,data4) Empty Empty   (key5,data5)
                        .  .   .
</pre>
</blockquote>
In other words, the internal nodes of such trees hold the key and the data
items, each internal node has a left and a right subtree and the
leaves are empty trees. Of course, since this is a
binary <i>search</i> tree, the organization is such that the keys in
the left subtree at any point are smaller than the key at the node and
the keys in the right subtree are larger than the key at the node;
note that this property holds recursively as described. 
<ol>
<li> Provide a type declaration that identifies a type constructor
  called <tt>btree</tt> that takes a pair of arguments corresponding
  to the type of the key and the type of the data and associated value
  constructors that can be used to represent trees of the form shown
  above. After you have provided this declaration, we should be able
  to write down OCaml expressions of type <tt>(ty1,ty2) btree</tt>,
  for suitable types <tt>ty1</tt> and <tt>ty2</tt>, that represent
  trees of the kind we are interested in. <br>
  <b>Note:</b> The OCaml type system is not strong enough to capture
  the ordering property for search trees, so don't spend time trying
  to do this. Instead, this ordering property will be an invariant of
  the trees we construct and manipulate through the functions we
  write.
<p>
<li>Define a function of the following name and type 
<blockquote>
<pre>
   find : ('a, 'b) btree -> 'a -> 'b option
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes a binary search tree and a key as input and that returns
the data value stored in the tree corresponding to the key. Assume
that there is exactly one entry per key in the tree. The return type
has the <tt>option</tt> form in case the tree does not contain an entry
corresponding to the given key. In defining this function you should
obviously assume the invariant associated with binary search trees. 
<p>
<li>Define a function of the following name and type
<blockquote>
<pre>
   insert : ('a, 'b) btree -> 'a -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) btree
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes a binary search tree, a key and a data item and returns a
new binary search tree that corresponds to the old tree with the given
key and data item pair inserted into it. (In case your experience with
programming in languages such as Java or C is confusing you, we <b>do
  not</b> modify the old tree in OCaml but we can reuse parts of it in
constructing the new tree.) You should assume that the input tree
satisfies the ordering invariant on binary search trees and your
function is expected to preserve this invariant. One other question
that often comes up: what should we do if the key already appears in
the tree? The new tree should not have the old key and data
association, it should have only the new one. 
<p>
One important question: what ordering relation to use on the key type?
In this assignment, assume that the usual, overloaded ordering
relations &lt; and &gt; and also the equality relation <tt>=</tt> will
work on this type, i.e., you can use them directly in your code. We
will think of better ways of handling this aspect in future
assignments, after we have talked about higher-order functions.  
<p>
<li>Define a function of the following name and type
<blockquote>
<pre>
   keylist : ('a, 'b) btree -> ('a list)
</pre>
</blockquote>
that will traverse the tree and produce a list of the keys in it in
the following order: first the keys in the left subtree will be
listed, then the key at a node and then the keys in the right
subtree. This kind of traversal is called an <i>in-order</i> traversal
and it has the result of producing an ordered listing of the keys.
<p>
<li>Define a function of the following name and type
<blockquote>
<pre>
  delete : ('a, 'b) btree -> 'a -> ('a, 'b) btree
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes a binary search tree and a key and returns a new binary
search tree that corresponds to the old tree with a possible entry in
it corresponding to the given key removed. Remember, you have to
maintain the invariant for binary search trees in the process.<p>
<b>Note:</b> This part is somewhat difficult, so do not get
discouraged if you are not able to solve it to your
satisfaction. However, give it your best shot, this will prepare you
for understanding a solution when we discuss it in class. <p>
<b>Hint:</b> Since it is a slightly harder part, a suggestion may be
useful. First write a function that takes a non-empty tree and
produces a new tree from it that does not contain what was at the
root; in my code, I called this function <tt>delete_root</tt>. Then
organize the <tt>delete</tt> function so that it locates the node to
be removed and uses <tt>delete_root</tt> to do this.
</ol>
Remember the general requirements in this course; <b>Your type
  constructor and functions must be named as we have described them
  here and must have the types we have indicated for them so that we
  can run automated tests on your program.</b> This is essential for
  getting credit for the work.

<h2>Problem 5 (4 + 10 points)</h2>

In this problem we will look at representing simple expressions from
OCaml in OCaml and doing some computations on them based on such a
representation. The particular computation we will carry out in this
problem is evaluating them, i.e., you will write an interpreter for
them. Because 
the collection of expressions is very limited, the task will be quite
simple. However, it will expose you to the basic ideas underlying
building interpreters and other programs of this sort and hence will
get you prepared for more involved and exciting things of this kind
that we will try later. 
<p>
First, for the expression language. The collection of expressions we
will look at are captured by the following type declaration in OCaml
<blockquote>
<pre>
type expr = 
       Id of string                     (* for identifiers *)
     | Int of int                       (* for integers *)
     | Plus of expr * expr              (* for exp1 + exp2 *)
     | Minus of expr * expr             (* for exp1 - exp2 *)
     | Times of expr * expr             (* for exp1 * exp2 *)
     | Div of expr * expr               (* for exp1 / exp2, integer division *)
     | Lss of expr * expr               (* for exp1 < exp2 *)
     | Eq of expr * expr                (* for exp1 = exp2, equality test *)
     | Gtr of expr * expr               (* for exp1 > exp2 *)
     | Cond of expr * expr * expr       (* for if exp1 then exp2 else exp3 *)
     | Let of string * expr * expr      (* for let &lt;id&gt; = exp1 in exp2 *)
</pre>
</blockquote>
Lets see some concrete examples of expressions of this type and their
intended meaning. To denote the OCaml expression <tt>5 + 3</tt> we
would use the following expression of type <tt>expr</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Plus ((Int 5),(Int 3))
</pre>
</blockquote>
To denote the OCaml expression <tt>let x = 5 in let y = 7 in x +
  y</tt>, we would use the following expression of type <tt>expr</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Let ("x",(Int 5),Let ("y",(Int 7),Plus ((Id "x"),(Id "y"))))
</pre>
</blockquote>
Finally, to denote the OCaml expression
<blockquote>
<pre>
let x = 5 in 
  if ((x + 3) < 15) then 7 else 13
</pre>
</blockquote>
we would use the following expression of type <tt>expr</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Let ("x",
     Int 5,
     Cond (Lss (Plus (Id "x",Int 3),Int 15),
           Int 7,
           Int 13))
</pre>
</blockquote>
Your task in this problem is twofold:
<ol>
<li>Construct 4 different expressions distinct from those shown above
  and bind them to the names <tt>exp1</tt>,...,<tt>exp4</tt> through
  let declarations. For example, to bind the first example above
  to <tt>exp1</tt>, I did the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let exp1 = Plus ((Int 5),(Int 3))
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>Define a function of the following name and type
<blockquote>
<pre>
   eval : expr -> (string * int) list -> int
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes an expression of type <tt>expr</tt>, assuming the indicated
meaning for the different forms. For example, assuming <tt>exp1</tt>
is bound as above, I should have something like the following
interaction with OCaml:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# eval exp1 [];;
- : int = 8
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
The second argument for <tt>eval</tt> provides a binding for identifiers
that may appear in the expression. The expressions we try to evaluate
at the top level must not have unbound identifiers, so this list will
initially be empty. However, as we descend into the bodies of let
expressions, we have to carry along the bindings they create and we
use this list argument for that purpose. Note that the this list, that
is often referred to as an <i>environment</i> associates
an <i>integer</i> with each string. The assumption here is that in a
let, we evaluate the expression that the identifier is to be bound
to <i>eagerly</i>, i.e. before we make the binding. 
<p>
We are assuming that <i>all</i> our expressions evaluate to
integers. The question then is what the comparison forms
(<tt>Lss</tt>, <tt>Eq</tt> and <tt>Gtr</tt>) should evaluate
to. Assume that <i>true</i> is represented by <tt>1</tt>
and <i>false</i> by <tt>0</tt>. Assume also that the condition of
a <tt>Cond</tt> will always evaluate to one of these numbers;
type-checking, that will come before we think of using our evaluator
on expressions, will make sure that this condition holds. 
<p>
One final note: When evaluating an if-then-else, organize this so that
you evaluate the then or the else part only on demand, i.e. after you
have evaluated the condition and determined the case that needs to be
evaluated. 
</ol>
