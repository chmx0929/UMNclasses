<H2>Submission Protocol</h2>

All of your work for this assignment must be submitted in a file
named <i>hw3.ml</i>. Include your solutions for the third problem in a
comment in this file. <i>Mark the solutions clearly as solutions to
  the corresponding problems; this must be done in an OCaml comment
  line next to the solution.</i>
This file must be submitted to your private git repository in this course's
organization, i.e., umn-csci-2041S15/repo-abcde001. It must be accessible
from the root of this repository via the relative
  path <i>hw3/hw3.ml</i>. The programming problems are specific about
  the names of the types, functions and the types of the functions you
  must define. You <b>must</b> stick to the requirements spelled out
  in each case; if you don't do this, you will not get credit for what
  you have done for that part.

<p>
Before you start working on the homework, make sure to read the
comments on <a href="index.html#hwprotocol">the protocol for homeworks
    and the issues we consider when grading</a>. Note in particular
that you must pay attention to the structure of your programs, you
must not have excessively long lines and you must use indentation to
make your program text readable. Also avoid tabs: they show up
differently under different editors and can make your code look ugly,
something that <i>does matter</i> when we grade your work.

<h2>Problem 1 (5 points)</h2>

Define a function
<blockquote>
<pre>
  divide_list : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list * 'a list
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes a boolean function over a given type and a list of elements
of that type and divides the list into two lists, one containing all
the elements that satisfy the boolean function and the other
containing those that do not satisfy it. Here are some example
interactions that characterize the desired behaviour of the function:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# divide_list (fun x -> true) [];;
- : 'a list * 'a list = ([], [])
# divide_list (fun x -> if (String.length x < 4) then true else false)
	       ["this"; "is"; "a"; "list"; "of"; "mixed"; "length"; "strings"];;
- : string list * string list =
(["is"; "a"; "of"], ["this"; "list"; "mixed"; "length"; "strings"])
# divide_list  (fun x -> if (x mod 2 = 0) then true else false) [1;3;6;8;9;10];;
- : int list * int list = ([6; 8; 10], [1; 3; 9])
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
The second expression that we have asked OCaml to evaluate above makes
use of a library function called <tt>length</tt> that works on
strings. This library function is part of a <tt>String</tt> "module"
in OCaml and to use it we have to qualify it with the name of the
module; this is like the <tt>List</tt> module and the use that we made
in the lecture of the <tt>map</tt> function from that module. We will talk
explicitly about modules later in the course, for now just understand
how to use what the library modules provide. Also, you may find it
useful to know what OCaml provides you as library functions. For
this, look up Part IV of the
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.02/">OCaml
  manual</a>.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For credit in this problem, you must
define <tt>divide_list</tt> <b>without</b> the use of any OCaml
library functions.

<h2>Problem 2 (5 points)</h2>

In class we considered mapping a function over a list. We should be
able to do this for any recursive data type. In this problem we will
consider doing it for a binary tree. In particular, let us use the
representation for binary trees obtained from the following type
declaration:
<blockquote>
<pre>
type 'a btree =
    Empty
  | Node of 'a * 'a btree * 'a btree
</pre>
</blockquote>
Define a function
<blockquote>
<pre>
  treemap : 'a btree -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b btree
</pre>
</blockquote>
That takes a binary tree and a function that acts on the elements of
the binary tree as input and transforms the tree into a new tree that
is obtained by applying the function to each element in the tree.
<p>
To help you understand the function you need to define a bit better,
here are some example applications of it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# treemap (Node (4, Node (2, Empty, Empty), Node (5, Empty,Empty))) (fun x -> x + 3);;
- : int btree = Node (7, Node (5, Empty, Empty), Node (8, Empty, Empty))
# treemap (Node (4, Node (2, Empty, Empty), Node (5, Empty,Empty))) (fun x -> (x mod 2 = 0));;
- : bool btree =
Node (true, Node (true, Empty, Empty), Node (false, Empty, Empty))
#
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Problem 3 (4 + 4 points)</h2>

For each of the function definitions below
<ul>
<li> explicitly follow the process that was explained in connection
  with the definition of <tt>append</tt> in class to determine if the
function definition is type correct, and

<p>
<li>at the end of it, indicate what type is inferred for the
  function.
</ul>
<i>You must show your work for the first of the items above for
  credit in this problem.</i> Also, do not forget that you have to
  complete the type checking process to conclude that the function is
  in fact type correct; if you leave it half way through, it is not
  clear that the type you infer will actually work, and so you will
  lose credit.

<ol>
<li> The function <tt>accumulate</tt> defined as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  let rec accumulate f lst u =
      match lst with
      | [] -> u
      | (h::t) -> accumulate f t (f h u)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>The function <tt>exists2</tt> defined as follows
<blockquote>
<pre>
  let rec exists2 p l1 l2 =
     match (l1,l2) with
     | ([],_) -> true
     | (_,[]) -> true
     | ((h1::t1),(h2::t2)) ->
 	  (p h1 h2) || (exists2 p t1 t2)
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<p><hr><p>

<h2>Problem 4 (3 + 3 + 3 points)</h2>

Fill in the blanks below to complete the definitions of the functions
shown:
<ol>
<li> <tt>let append l1 l2 = reduce ___ l1 ___</tt>

<p>
<li> <tt>let reverse l1 = accumulate ___ l1 ___</tt>

<p>
<li> <tt>let filter f l1 = reduce ___ l1 ___</tt>
</ol>

In case you miss the definition of <tt>reduce</tt> in class, here it is
<blockquote>
<pre>
  let rec reduce f lst u =
     match lst with
     | [] -> u
     | (h::t) -> f h (reduce f t u)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Also, <tt>filter</tt> takes a boolean valued function and a list and
it produces a list with only the items in the input list that satisfy
the input function. Here is a sample interaction that brings its
expected behaviour out:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# filter (fun x -> (x mod 2 = 0)) [1;2;3;4;5;6];;
- : int list = [2; 4; 6]
# filter (fun x -> (x mod 2 = 0)) [];;
- : int list = []
# 
</pre>
</blockquote>
We will see a direct definition of <tt>filter</tt> that does not use
any predefined functions in class.

<h2>Problem 5 (5 + 8 points)</h2>

This problem continues one that you saw in the midterm exam concerning
substituting OCaml expressions for identifiers in other OCaml
expressions. The critical new part now is that we will also consider
substitutions in the context of let expressions. Concretely, let us
suppose that the expressions of interest are represented by
the <tt>expr</tt> type shown below:
<blockquote>
<pre>
type  expr =
  Id of string | Int of int
| Plus of expr * expr | Minus of expr * expr
| Let of string * expr * expr
</pre>
</blockquote>
The eventual task is the same as in the exam: you have to define a function
<blockquote>
<pre>
   subst : expr -> string -> expr -> expr
</pre>
</blockquote>
that takes an expression, the name of an identifier and an expression
to replace it with and returns an expression that is obtained by
replacing all occurrences of the identifier in the first expression by
the second one. Although this problem seems very much like the one in
the exam, the presence of let expressions makes it more
complicated. Let us understand this first and then see how to overcome
the problems.
<p>
There are actually two reasons why the task is more complicated.
<ul>
<li>First, if the name of the identifier being substituted for is
  identical to the identifier bound by the let, then no substitution
  should be made. For example, the following expression
<blockquote>
<pre>
subst (Let ("x", Id "y", (Plus (Id "x",Id "z")))) "x" (Int 3)
</pre>
</blockquote>
must not evaluate to
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Let ("x", Id "y", Plus (Int 3, Id "z"))
</pre>
</blockquote>
but to
<blockquote>
<pre>
Let ("x", Id "y", Plus (Id "x", Id "z")).
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note, however, that we still have to carry out the substitution in the
expression that the identifier is getting bound to. For example
<blockquote>
<pre>
subst (Let ("x", Id "x", (Plus (Id "x",Id "z")))) "x" (Int 3)
</pre>
</blockquote>
should evaluate to
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Let ("x", Int 3, Plus (Id "x", Id "z")).
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>When substituting into a let expression, we have to be careful
  that the expression being substituted does not have identifier
  occurrences that get bound by the let. For example, the expression
<blockquote>
<pre>
 subst (Let ("x", Id "y", Plus (Id "x", Id "z"))) "z" (Plus (Int 3, Id "x"))
</pre>
</blockquote>
must not evaluate to
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Let ("x", Id "y", Plus (Id "x", Plus (Int 3, Id "x")))
</pre>
</blockquote>
Instead, we should first "rename" the identifier bound by the let to get
an expression something like
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Let ("var1", Id "y", Plus (Id "var1", Id "z"))
</pre>
</blockquote>
and then carry out the substitution to get
<blockquote>
<pre>
 Let ("var1", Id "y", Plus (Id "var1", Plus (Int 3, Id "x")))
</pre>
</blockquote>
A natural question here is why the renaming is okay. The reason is
simple: the main purpose for the name of the identifier being bound by
the let is to determine where to use the expression it is being bound
to in the body of the let and so long as we preserve this
correspondence, we are not changing the meaning of the expression.
</ul>


Having understood the nuances of substitution, let us now turn to how
we can realize it correctly. We will do this in two steps.
<ol>
<li>First, define the function <tt>freeIn : expr -> string ->
    bool</tt> that takes an expression and a name and returns true if
    that name appears unbound in the expression. Here are some interactions
    that show the expected behaviour of <tt>freeIn</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# freeIn (Plus (Id "x", Id "y")) "x";;
- : bool = true
# freeIn (Plus (Id "x", Id "y")) "z";;
- : bool = false
# freeIn (Let ("x", Id "x", Plus (Id "x", Id "y"))) "x";;
- : bool = true
# freeIn (Let ("x", Id "z", Plus (Id "x", Id "y"))) "x";;
- : bool = false
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
This function will be used in the next part.
<p>
<li>Now define the function <tt>subst: expr -> string -> expr -> expr</tt>.
Use the function <tt>freeIn</tt> to determine if
  renaming is needed in a let expression. To determine this, you have
  to check if the name bound by the let appears in the expression
  being substituted. If you do need to rename, you will need a way
  to generate a new name. Use the following code
  for this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
let namecounter = ref 0
let newname () =
     ( namecounter := !namecounter + 1; "var" ^ string_of_int !namecounter)
</pre>
</blockquote>
We will talk about the meaning of this code later in the course. For
 now, just note that every time you need a new name, you just need to
 use the expression <tt>newname ()</tt>. Here is an interaction that
 shows how to use it and what happens when you do:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# newname ();;
- : string = "var1"
#
</pre>
</blockquote>
There is a possibility of course that the "new name" that is generated
 in this way also already appears in the expression but, for this
 homework, it is okay to assume that the name will actually be
 fresh. If you are really bold and would like also to avoid the
 potential for such clashes, talk to me, I can help you figure out
 how not to have to rely on this assumption.
