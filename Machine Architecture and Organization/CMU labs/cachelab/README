This is the cachelab-handout directory for the Cache Lab. 

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim 

Check the correctness and performance of your matrix wavefront transport functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 256 -N 256 -s 5 -E 2 -b 3
    linux> ./test-trans -M 256 -N 256 -s 8 -E 2 -b 3

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructorruns):
    linux> ./driver.py
