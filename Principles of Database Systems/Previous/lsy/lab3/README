2. Source code files that we modified: postgressql-9.2.1/src/backend/storage/buffer/freelist.c


3. At first, we define a new type to control which replace policy that we want to use. The type is REPLACE_POLICY. When the value of REPLACE_POLICY is 0, we use FIFO policy. When the value of REPLACE_POLICY is 1, we use the original clock sweep policy. Secondly, we need to define the FIFO algorithm. In this algorithm, we need to scan from the first slot of the buffer. So we assign StrategyControl->nextVictimBuffer to 0. And then, we need to see the whether this buffer has been pinned. If not, we can return it. If it has been pinned, we continue to check the next buffer. We keep doing those steps until we find an usable buffer. If we scan the whole buffer pool and find no usable buffer, return null and print error.
